# Wave Interference Sandbox
This project simulates wave interference patterns using fundamental principles of physics. It models how waves propagate, overlap, and interact with each other in a shared medium. By visualizing constructive and destructive interference, the simulation demonstrates how and when wave amplitudes combine or cancel out.

Users can adjust parameters such as wavelength, frequency, the detector's position, and sources positions to observe how interference patterns change based on distance. The simulator represents two speakers emitting the same frequency sound.

The goal of the project is to visualize wave interferance to make it's patterns easier to understand.
